# scribd-downloader
A tampermonkey / greasemonkey tool to download Scridb.com content

\* Only works with premium account.

\* Some content are not downloadable. 

### How it works

#### Documents
When you reach the document url, e.g. `https://pt.scribd.com/document/[the_document]`, some buttons will appear on bottom left of your page.

For documents we have **Download PDF** and the variation **Download as PDF Mobile**, the second option download as PDF ebook, with links, if this is available.

#### Books
When you reach the content url for book, e.g. `https://pt.scribd.com/read/[the_book]`, some buttons will appear on bottom left of your page.

For books we have **Get content** and **Print**.

**Get content** will walk and scrap all content in the pages.

**Print** will open a new page with the content. Just do `CTRl + P` or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and print as PDF or print in paper.
